What You're Aiming For

Welcome to your second checkpoint, and congratulations on making it this far.

It’s time to practice what we’ve learned.  You will be creating a portfolio web page. You will find an example in the link below and it will recreate the structure using HTML.

At this checkpoint, you’re instructed to:

use semantic tags.
add a video/audio to the web page.
use local links, lists, or tables.
use HTML forms.
